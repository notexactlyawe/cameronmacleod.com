Title: Projects
Slug: projects

This page contains links to most of my projects. Presumably the most important ones are the onest that I remembered to include, so feel free to consider this conclusive.

**[Abracadabra](http://github.com/notexactlyawe/abracadabra)** - This is a Shazam-style sound recogniser that I am writing in Python. Documentation is a little sparse right now, but it basically consists a fingerprinter and a storage system.

**[Image to ASCII art converter](https://github.com/notexactlyawe/ascii-art)** - Exactly what it says on the tin. Not a polished tool at all, but it (usually) does the job and there are instructions in the repo for setting it up.

**[SpellingBee](https://github.com/notexactlyawe/SpellingBee)** - AS project for computing. This repo is disgusting and was made before I understood many things including git, so please excuse it. Hopefully at some point I will get to tidy it up. It is a spelling test application with features such as logins and a database of the entirety of the English language according to wiktionary at that time. The most interesting code written for it was the code that parsed the wiktionary dump. Unfortunately the only code not saved was the code that parsed the wiktionary dump.

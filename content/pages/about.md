Title: About Me
Slug: about

Hello! My name is Cameron and I make things. I quite like software and I quite like hardware and sometimes I mix the two. Other than code I can often be found doing things with languages or music and sometimes photography.

I currently work for a company called [Cambridge Consultants](http://cambridgeconsultants.com) in the Software group. My work ends up ranging from writing code for BLE chips to implementing DSP algorithms to writing plugins for desktop applications.

This is my personal site and so views presented here do not necessarily reflect those of my employer.

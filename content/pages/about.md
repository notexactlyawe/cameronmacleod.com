Title: About Me
Slug: about

Hello! My name is Cameron and I make things. I quite like software and I quite like hardware and sometimes I mix the two. Other than code I can often be found doing things with languages or music and sometimes photography.

I am currently a Computer Science student at the University of Edinburgh. If you would like to hire me, then perhaps you would like a look at my [CV](/cv). If not, then why not take a look at my [projects](/projects)?

This is my personal site and so views presented here do not necessarily reflect those of my employer.

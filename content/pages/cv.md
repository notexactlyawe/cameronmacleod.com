Intro
-----

I am a computer science student at the University of Edinburgh with a wide range of experience in areas both within software development and outside it.

I have worked with a large set of technologies including Python, Flask, Android, C, Elixir, .NET and JavaScript. I frequently attend Meetup groups in software areas and hackathons both to help improve my skills and for fun. My interests outside of software include bass guitar, hockey and languages. I am fluent in Spanish and am learning Russian at university.


Previous Positions
------------------

**Cambridge Consultants** (September 2015-September 2016)

I was part of the Tech Scholar programme, which meant that I was involved in a wide variety of work in areas across the company. I worked on projects in (frequently overlapping) areas from embedded devices to DSP to computer vision. The job required learning new technologies rapidly and being able to change mindsets quickly to solve different problems.

**Ironcraft Fires and Stoves Ltd.** (Summer 2012)

Ironcraft is a small business in my home town that wanted to improve its online presence. Over the course of 3 months I managed to increase the unique monthly visitor count for the site from 300 to 1400 and improve both the usability and speed of their website.

Voluntary positions
-------------------

**Shrewsbury Museum and Art Gallery** (September 2014-July 2015)

I was a gallery guide at my local museum. This involved helping visitors to engage with the exhibits and improving their experience at the museum. Occasionally it also involved me helping with maintenance of some of the interactive displays.

**First Aider - St John Ambulance** (June 2016-)

I am a qualified FA with St John Ambulance and during my time in Cambridge I was involved with their event cover. I enjoyed the role as it is a genuine chance to make a positive difference to people and am hoping to join St Andrew's First Aid during my time in Edinburgh as St John does not operate as a first aid organisation in Scotland.

**The Centre for Computing History** (October 2015-August 2016)

I was in a customer facing role, mostly manning front desk, but also occasionally showing visitors round and helping them appreciate the exhibits.

**STEM Ambassador** (January 2016-)

I am a STEM ambassador with STEMNET. STEMNET arrange many events to excite children about STEM careers and I am often involved in the events that focus on software. I have done some work with the BBC micro:bit as a result of this.


Personal projects
-----------------

**abracadabra**

abracadabra came about through my attempt to understand how Shazam works. It is a Python implementation of the paper "An Industrial Strength Audio Search Algorithm" by the creators of Shazam. I gave a talk on the project at EuroPython 2016, the English and Spanish versions are linked below.

English: [Implementing a Sound Identifier in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ7THTB88AE)

Spanish: [Implementaci√≥n de un Identificador de Sonido en Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMMHJch77dk)

**Others**

I have done a variety of projects in my spare time to learn new concepts, languages and frameworks. A list of the non-trivial ones can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/notexactlyawe). These include generating ASCII art from images, exploring genetic algorithms and automated lesson generation.


University
----------

During my first year my courses include:

**Functional Programming** - An introduction to Haskell and thinking in the functional paradigm.

**Computation and Logic** - Covers the foundations of formal logic, and introduces the idea of computing. This includes concepts such as regular languages, finite state machines and resolution.

**Russian Studies 1A** - An ab initio intensive course in Russian language and culture. Runs for the full year.

Title: First Post

So as you can probably tell from the title, this is the first post of what will (hopefully) become my blog.

First, [a little bit about me](/about). And [here](/projects) are some projects I have done.

For good measure, and following the trend, [here](/cv) is where the CV will be located.

Since you got past the fold, I will let you in on a little secret. Are you listening closely?

Get a bit closer.

Right, are you ready?

Are you really ready?

OK, here goes - this post is mostly to make the home page have some content since it would otherwise have none. Pretty juicy ain't it?

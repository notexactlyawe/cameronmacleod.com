Lots of people who are learning to code ask the question "Should I get a CS degree or do a bootcamp?", or "Is a degree necessary?". I have just finished my degree (not graduated yet), and while I can't give all the answers to these questions, I can share my experience.

In this post I will go into detail about what my degree contained. You can use this information to decide whether university is for you, make your own curriculum, or even just see how the syllabus has changed since you went.

I don't want to tell you to get a degree, and I equally don't want to tell you to not get one. It is a personal choice. However, on the whole I'm very pleased that I went to university. I learned a lot of things that I wouldn't have otherwise, but more importantly, I met lots of great people and had experiences that I couldn't have had in any other setting. The piece of paper that I will get once I graduate is important for the [job I chose](/blog/why-pm-over-software), but it won't be important for everyone on my course.

Below you will find a list of every module I took in the course of my degree and their content. Not every degree will look like this, I had a lot of elective modules and some universities are more practical than others, but this should give you an idea of what university can offer.

The courses are broken down by year and semester. Each course has the following structure.

This is a Bachelor of Science (Hons) degree from the University of Edinburgh. It is under the Scottish university system, so it is four years long. Each year is composed of two semesters and you need to take 120 credits of courses across these semesters.

**Disclaimer:** This is not a comprehensive guide to the degree program at Edinburgh, if you are looking for that, go to [DRPS (Degree Regulations and Programmes of Study)](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/). I have tried not to include my opinions of the courses, since it's the syllabus that's important.

With that out the way, here's the full list.

<div class="csdegree-year">
  <h2>Year 1</h2>
  <p>Year 1 had 40 credits free for optional modules. The number of free credits in first year may be higher in Scotland than elsewhere due to Scottish universities doing a four year bachelors degree.</p>

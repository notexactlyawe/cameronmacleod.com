==================

These are the source files that I use to generate my personal site with. [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com) is the static site generator that I use. The output from Pelican is also stored here on GitHub in a [separate repository](https://github.com/notexactlyawe/notexactlyawe.github.io) since I use GitHub pages to host.

To get up and running with this site, you need to install Pelican, which can be done with Pip.

`pip install pelican`

The version I am using is 3.6.3.

You can then just run `pelican -o notexactlyawe.github.io/` from this directory to create the output files in the folder `notexactlyawe.github.io`.
